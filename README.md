## My process
I began by creating an HTML page that was both desktop and mobile friendly.
Then I worked on CSS for the desktop before moving on to responsive for mobile phones.
I concluded the project by writing some Javascript for the mobile hamburger. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I studied how to utilize CSS Grid and practiced CSS Flexbox. It also gave me the opportunity to work on responsive design.
### Continued development

I was able to improve the design, which was not fully comparable to the supplied design.
I could also try to create a full-stack application using the FrontEnd Mentor challenges. 

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me to apprehend CSS Grid.
